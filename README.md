Minimal, cross-browser JavaScript XHR library.

I set out to build this a couple of years ago, and I did, but for an internal project which I couldn't open source. Recently, I came across the [axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios) project which looks pretty much like what I had in mind here. Incidently, it looks like that project started in August 2014, which is about the same time I had started thinking about this. I'm glad Axios appears to be a thriving project!
